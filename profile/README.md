Repositories moving to this namespace (`@recaptime-dev/archive` on GitLab and `hub:~recaptime-dev/archived` on sourcehut are considered as archived
or no longer maintained. Although archived, we kept them there to declutter things and while we're open to adopt them as a new maintainer, please
check the README and contact us first (you'll be welcome to fork as always).
